# ghg-emissions-ontario-analysis
Data-driven analysis of Ontarioâ€™s public sector GHG emissions (2012â€“2023) using descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics to identify major emitters, forecast trends, and recommend strategies for emission reduction through renewables and efficiency improvements.
# Reducing GHG Emissions in Ontario: A Data-Driven Approach

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data across Ontarioâ€™s public sectors from **2012 to 2023**. Leveraging **Python**, **machine learning models**, and **data visualization tools**, we identify emission hotspots, forecast future trends, and simulate policy interventions such as renewable energy adoption.  

The work was completed as part of the **BIA-5450 Capstone Project** at Humber College.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Identify high-emission sectors and regions in Ontario.
- Determine key drivers of elevated GHG emissions.
- Forecast future emissions based on historical trends.
- Evaluate renewable energy adoption and operational improvement strategies.
- Provide actionable policy recommendations.

---

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources
- Publicly available Ontario **Public Sector Energy Use and GHG Emissions** datasets (2012â€“2023).
- Energy metrics: Electricity consumption (kWh), Natural gas consumption, COâ‚‚ emissions (kg).
- Operational attributes: Facility type, sector, location, and operational details.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Power BI** (Interactive dashboards and visualizations)
- **Excel** (Initial cleaning and data integration)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Exploratory Data Analysis & Modeling)

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaning, normalization, and integration of multi-year datasets.
   - Feature engineering (energy intensity, emissions intensity).
   - One-hot encoding of categorical variables.

2. **Analytics**
   - **Descriptive:** Trends, hotspots, and sector comparisons.
   - **Diagnostic:** Correlation analysis to find emissions drivers.
   - **Predictive:** Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for forecasting.
   - **Prescriptive:** Cost-benefit analysis for solar adoption scenarios.

3. **Visualization**
   - Time-series trends
   - Heatmaps of sectoral emissions
   - RMSE & RÂ² model performance charts
   - Clustering analysis

---

## ðŸš€ Key Findings
- **Hospitals** and **Post-secondary institutions** are major contributors to emissions in multiple cities.
- **Random Forest** outperformed other models with **RÂ² = 0.98**.
- Solar adoption scenarios reveal potential for significant emission reduction, though anomalies highlight areas for model refinement.
- COVID-19 restrictions in 2020â€“2021 coincided with a notable drop in emissions.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Recommendations
1. Prioritize renewable energy investments in high-emission sectors.
2. Improve data governance with real-time monitoring systems.
3. Integrate more granular facility-level data for accurate forecasting.
4. Enhance regulatory frameworks to incentivize energy efficiency.
